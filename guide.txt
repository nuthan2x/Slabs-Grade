1. used enums to reduce storage slots instead of arrays
2. not storing the slabs on any storage as it is read using a getsslab function
3. used 2 layers of mapping a user to (mappings of erc20tokenaddress to amount).
     mapping instead of mapping array of structs to a user.
4. wrote less functions , still can be minimal by removing getslabs function as we can get that data,
     using events emitted when soeone clicks deposit button and show it in frontend,
     but if want for validation within the contract it is mandatory to keep as it reduces gas for storage warm and cold access.
